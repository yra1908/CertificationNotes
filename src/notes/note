The | operator, when applied for boolean operands, ensures that both the sides are evaluated.
This is opposed to || which does not evaluate the Right Hand Side if the result can be known by just evaluating the Left Hand Side.


STRING
String substring(int beginIndex)                    Returns a new string that is a substring of this string.
String substring(int beginIndex, int endIndex)      Returns a new string that is a substring of this string.

int indexOf(int ch)                  Returns the index within this string of the first occurrence of the specified character.
int indexOf(int ch, int fromIndex)   Returns the index within this string of the first occurrence of the specified character, starting the search at the specified index.
int indexOf(String str)              Returns the index within this string of the first occurrence of the specified substring.
int indexOf(String str, int fromIndex) Returns the index within this string of the first occurrence of the specified substring, starting at the specified index.



PRIMITIVES
Note that float d = 0 * 1.5f; and float d = 0 * (float)1.5 ; are OK

A narrowing primitive conversion may be used if all of the following conditions are satisfied:
1. The expression is a constant expression of type int.
2. The type of the variable is byte, short, or char.
3. The value of the expression (which is known at compile time, because it is a constant expression) is representable in the type of the variable.
Note that narrowing conversion does not apply to long or double. So, char ch = 30L; will fail even though 30 is representable in char.
